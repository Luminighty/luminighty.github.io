# Vector2

Used to define a point in a 2D enviroment
 - x : Number
 - y : Number
```javascript
let vec = {x: 3, y: 5}; 
```
For easier usage and additional methods the Vector2 class exists inside the `Struct.js` module

```javascript
import {Vector2} from './engine/Struct';

// the default constructor
let vec = new Vector2(3, 5);
// It is possible to use an array for the constructor
let vec = new Vector2([3, 5]);
// You can convert the other to a class
let vec = new Vector2({x: 3, y: 5});
```

## Properties
| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | The x value for the position | [Number] |
| y | The y value for the position | [Number] |
| magnitude | The length of the vector | [Number] |
| sqrMagnitude | The length of the vector squared (faster than magnitude) | [Number] |
| normalized | Returns the vector with a magnitude of 1 | [Vector2] |

## Methods
| Name | Description | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| get | Get X or Y value | [Number] |
| add | Adds the vector's components to the other one and returns with the new Vector2 | [Vector2] |
| subtract | Subtracts the vector's components to the other one and returns with the new Vector2 | [Vector2] |
| multiply | Multiplies the vector's components and returns with a new Vector2 | [Vector2] |
| divide | Divides the vector's components and returns with a new Vector2 | [Vector2] |
| negate | Negates the vector's components and returns with a new Vector2 | [Vector2] |
